# LCV model
# A Swiss model for Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV)

The transport modeling team within the Swiss Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications aims at developing a national model for LCV. The main objectives are (i) to provide a reasonable description of the current average daily traffic at the link-level for the road network and (ii) to permit the translation of long-term demographic and economic projections into traffic forecasts suitable for infrastructure planning.

This repository contains a working version of the technical report. The associated Python code will be added once it is cleaned.
