# Swiss traffic model for Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV)

This repository hosts the code and documentation relative to the Swiss model for Light Commercial Vehicles, as well as a smaller separate model, which is specific for parcel deliveries.

For an overview of the Swiss model for LCVs, see: https://github.com/AREschweiz/LCV_model/blob/main/Swiss_LCV_model_technical_report.pdf

For a description of the model for parcel deliveries, see first the appendix C of report referenced above. Then for technical details, the Section 4.1.5 of the following report:
https://github.com/AREschweiz/LCV_model/blob/main/22064-R01%20-%20Report%20Audit%20and%20update%20of%20Swiss%20national%20LCV%20model%20-%20update%2020230602.pdf

The results of the models (i.e. the resulting matrices) will be available soon on Zenodo.

Note: in order to apply the model, it is needed to have access to the number of FTE per NOGA Section. This data is not publicly available.
