# LCV model
# A Swiss model for Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV)

The transport modeling team within the Swiss Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications is developing a national model for LCV.
This repository hosts both the code and documentation relative to this project.

- Swiss_LCV_model_technical_report.pdf : report giving an overview of the model (an update is planned for August 2023)
- The document "22064-R01 - Report Audit and update of Swiss national LCV model - update 20230602.pdf" contains a report of the audit & improvements carried out by Significance in 2022-2023.

The scripts generated by Significance will be uploaded in August 2023, together with the updated technical report.
